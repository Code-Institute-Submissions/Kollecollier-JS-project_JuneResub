# Features

  -  Featured at the top right of the page there is a simple statment declaring you to "Make Your Choice" in a bright color so it isnt missable.

    -  In the header there are 3 diffrent hand emoji's to select pick from, each representing diffrent function's. First is "Rock" second is "Paper" third is "Siccors".

    -  Also the icons are responsive to the mouse, upon hover it triggers a smooth and satisfying scale tranform.
